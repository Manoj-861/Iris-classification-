# Iris-classification-
Iris Flower Classification is a Machine Learning project that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its petal and sepal dimensions. It uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM for accurate classification. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation using Python and Scikit-learn.
