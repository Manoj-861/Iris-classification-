# Iris-classification-
Iris Flower Classification is a Machine Learning project that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its petal and sepal dimensions. It uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM for accurate classification. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation using Python and Scikit-learn.
Iris Flower Classification

The Iris Classification project is a classic Machine Learning problem that involves predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It uses supervised learning algorithms to classify flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

The project covers the complete ML workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature visualization, and model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can be applied to simple yet powerful classification problems, serving as a strong foundation for beginners to understand the core ML concepts and techniques.
